Insertion Sort Algorithm

Description: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the array and repeatedly inserts each unsorted element into its correct position in the sorted sequence.

Parameters: arr: An array of numbers to be sorted using the Insertion Sort algorithm. Returns: Returns the sorted array. Algorithm: Initialization: Get the length of the input array. Main Loop: Iterate through the array starting from the second element. Shift Greater Elements: Move elements of the sorted portion that are greater than the current element to one position ahead of their current position. Insertion: Insert the current element into its correct position in the sorted sequence. Return Sorted Array: Return the sorted array
